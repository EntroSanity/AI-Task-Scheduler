# AI-Powered Task Scheduler

## Overview

The AI-Powered Task Scheduler is an advanced project management tool that leverages machine learning to optimize task scheduling. It handles complex project scenarios, including dependency cycles and resource conflicts, while maximizing project rewards and minimizing completion time. This application consists of a Python backend for task analysis and scheduling, and a frontend interface for user interaction and visualization.

## Quick Start
For a quick setup and run of the AI-Powered Task Scheduler, you can use our Docker image. Follow these steps:
1. Pull the Docker image:
```
docker pull ntosnaky/ai-task-scheduler:v0.5
```
2. Run the Docker container:
```
docker run -p 3001:3000 -p 8080:8080 \                      
  -e REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your_replicate_API_token> \
  ntosnaky/ai-task-scheduler:v0.5
```
3. Access the application: Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3001/
```
Note: Make sure you have Docker installed on your system before running these commands. This method allows you to quickly set up and run the AI-Powered Task Scheduler without needing to install dependencies or set up the development environment manually.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10+
- [PyGraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html)
- Replicate API (for LLM integration)
- NetworkX (for dependency graph creation)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Plotly (for Gantt chart creation)
- Click (for CLI)

(A `requirements.txt` file is included in the project root for easy installation of all dependencies. Please ensure to review the PyGraphviz installation guide before proceeding with the installation of this dependency.)

## Configuration

The project uses a `config.toml` file for various settings. You can modify this file to change default behaviors:

- Input and output directory paths
- Scheduler parameters
- Visualization settings
- LLM model and settings

The `config.toml` file is located in the project root directory.

## Installation
### Backend
1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/EntroSanity/AI-Task-Scheduler.git
```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
conda create -n scheduling python=3.10
conda activate scheduling
```
3. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Set up your environment variables - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Replicate API key::
```
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your_api_key_here>
```
### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend/
```
2. Install the required npm packages:
```bash
npm install
```


## Usage
To run the AI-Powered Task Scheduler:
1. Start the backend server:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the backend server, typically on port 8080.

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
This will start the frontend development server, typically on port 3000 or 3001.

3. Access the application:
Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3001/` to interact with the AI-Powered Task Scheduler. Ensure that both the backend and frontend servers are running simultaneously for the application to function properly.
